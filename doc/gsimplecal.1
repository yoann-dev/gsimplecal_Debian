.SH NAME
gsimplecal \- lightweight calendar applet


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gsimplecal
.br
.B gsimplecal
next_month
.br
.B gsimplecal
prev_month


.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the usage of the
.B gsimplecal
command.

.PP
.B gsimplecal
is a lightweight calendar applet. When it is started, it first shows up, when
you run it again, it closes the running instance. It was intentionally made for
use with tint2 panel to be launched upon clock click, but of course it will
work without it, you can bind it to some hotkey in you window manager, for
example.

.PP
When you provide one of the arguments —
.B next_month
or
.B prev_month
— instead of closing the running instance, the displaying month is changed.


.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
You may configure gsimplecal to display different world timezones clocks.
To make it, you should create
.nh
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gsimplecal/config\fP
.ny
file (usually it will be
.nh
~/.config/gsimplecal/config)
.ny
with the following contents:

.IP
show_calendar = 1
.br
show_timezones = 1
.br
mark_today = 1
.br
external_viewer = sunbird --cool-arg --date="%Y-%m-%d"
.br
clock_format = %a %d %b %H:%M
.br
mainwindow_decorated = 0
.br
mainwindow_keep_above = 1
.br
mainwindow_sticky = 0
.br
mainwindow_skip_taskbar = 1
.br
mainwindow_position = none
.br
clock_label = UTC
.br
clock_tz = :UTC
.br
clock_label = Local
.br
clock_tz = 

.PP
The options are pretty self explanatory, but here is detailed description:

.TP 5
\fBshow_calendar\fP: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
Sets whether the calendar should be shown. Most users want this option to be 1.

.TP 5
\fBshow_timezones\fP: 1 or 0, defaults to 0.
Sets whether the different timezone clocks should be shown.

.TP 5
\fBmark_today\fP: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
Sets whether today's date will be marked in the calendar (besides the default
selection, i.e. when you click on the other day, today will remain marked
somehow, e.g. in bold print).

.TP 5
\fBexternal_viewer\fP: string, defaults to empty string.
Command line to run when doubleclicking a date. This string is strftime'd
(see \fIman strftime\fP for the possible substitutions)
and passed to the shell. Thus you can use pipes, redirections, and whatever,
I hope.
.br
Currently the shell is hardcoded to
.nh
/bin/sh
.ny
though. I hope that will do for all the users, but if you've got a trouble,
please file a ticket (see \fIREPORTING BUGS\fP).

.TP 5
\fBclock_format\fP: string
Sets the clocks format. Look \fIman strftime\fP for the possible formats.

.TP 5
\fBmainwindow_decorated\fP: 1 or 0, defaults to 0.
Tells your window manager to decorate or not to decorate the main window.

.TP 5
\fBmainwindow_keep_above\fP: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
Sets whether the main window should be placed on top of other windows by your
window manager.

.TP 5
\fBmainwindow_sticky\fP: 1 or 0, defaults to 0.
Tells your window manager to show gsimplecal on all desktops.

.TP 5
\fBmainwindow_skip_taskbar\fP: 1 or 0, defaults to 1.
Sets whether the main window should be shown in the task list by your panel or
window manager.

.TP 5
\fBmainwindow_position\fP: mouse|center|none, defaults to mouse.
Tells your window manager where to place the gsimplecal window:
.TP 10
     \fBmouse\fP
.br
close to the mouse cursor position (this one is useful when you bind gsimplecal
on some mouse click command);
.TP 10
     \fBcenter\fP
.br
in the center of the screen;
.TP 10
     \fBnone\fP
.br
it's up to your window manager to decide, where to place the window
(this one is useful when you bind gsimplecal invocation on some hotkey, so you
can configure your window manager to place gsimplecal in some predefined
position).

.TP 5
\fBclock_label\fP and \fBclock_tz\fP: string
These two options should go in pairs and \fBmust\fP be in the order given.
.br
Each pair creates new clock. The clock_label variable sets the string to be
displayed near the clock, the clock_tz sets the timezone.
.br
If you omit the value for clock_tz, local time will be shown.
.br
For a list of timezones see \fIman timezone\fP, or \fIls /usr/share/zoneinfo\fP


.SH KEYBOARD ACCELERATORS
.PP
You may use the following keyboard accelerators while gsimplecal window has a focus:

.IP
Escape, Ctrl+w, Ctrl+q: close the window
.br
j: switch to the next month
.br
k: switch to the previous month
.br
J: jump one year forward
.br
K: jump one year backward
.br
g, Home: jump to the current date

.PP
These are not yet configurable, but I'm working on it.
